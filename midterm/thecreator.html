             <p>Hello everyone! It's nice to meet you all!</p>
        <p>My name is Kenny Yu, I'm currently thinking about what my gender identity is (most likely a she), and I'm 25 years old and attending Bellevue College for my Digital Media Arts Degree (and more if my current field of interest requires it.)</p>
        <p>I am a Self-Taught 2D Digital Artist and a 3D Artist, but attending classes on 3D Design to enhance my current skills. I am passionate about video games and I'm taking classes so that I can become a Game Designer/Developer. What I plan to do is to become someone who can lead a team of other game designers so that I can produce my video game ideas to the world, while also owning my own online merch store, creating 3D models for other individuals as a side gig.</p>
        
        <p>I'm into digital art, figurines, anime merch gaming, watching films, going shopping and having fun.</p>
