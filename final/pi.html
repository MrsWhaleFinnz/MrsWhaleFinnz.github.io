        <p>Video games have always been with me since my younger childhood days. I was born in the late 90s, so video games was progressively changing and improving as I slowly grew up with it into what it is now. Despite that I loved playing with other things like toys, legos, action figures etc, video games have always been the top of my favorite enjoyable activites. Video games were so much simplier at the time and it elements such as online gameplay, DLC or digital content wasn't a thing. 
     Nowadays, the norm is that all video games have some form of digital content and online play, as if they were always meant to be.</p>
        <p>Growing up, I've always wondered about what I can create in my video games, how I can make it unique and something that no one has ever done before. I've played too many different types of video games and I'm constantly thinking of ways to create something new, something that has that magic of replayability and can bring people together in many communities. </p>
        <p>Right now, at this very moment that I'm typing this, I have something planned. I can confidentally say that I'm ready to start with this idea and hope that it can be a whole new genre of gaming that people will enjoy.</p>

          Starting a few years back, I began to grow an interest of digital 3D modeling and 3D printing figurines of characters whether if it's owned by another artist or from a series. Fortunately for me, I've already had prior experience with 3D modeling, but right now I'm currently taking classes to enhance my current skills and also learning how to 3D print, smooth the model, paint and apply all of the necessary elements needed to create the perfect character model thanks to a roommate of mine.

<p>I've only posted one video so far. There will be more once I settle down with everything I got planned. There's just a lot going on and I need time to get everything back in order.</p>
